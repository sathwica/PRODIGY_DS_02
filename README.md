Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my solution for Task 2 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. In this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, quality, and patterns within the dataset.

✅ What I Did

-> Imported and inspected the dataset using Pandas
-> Identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers
-> Performed data type corrections and feature formatting
-> Generated exploratory visualizations using Matplotlib / Seaborn
-> Analyzed distributions, correlations, and key statistical summaries
-> Derived insights to understand hidden patterns and dataset behavior

🛠️ Tech Stack

-> Python
-> Pandas
-> NumPy
-> Matplotlib / Seaborn
-> Jupyter Notebook

📌 Outcome

This task strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, data quality assessment, and exploratory analysis, helping build a strong foundation for machine learning workflows.
